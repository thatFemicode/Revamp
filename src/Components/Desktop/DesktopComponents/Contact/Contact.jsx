      <h1>Impressed you?</h1>
      <p>
        Send me a mail, let's have a conversation about an opportunity you have
        for me, i'd be glad,
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently looking for my first role as a software engineer in the
        industry. I live in Lagos Nigeria and open to opportunities either
        remote or onsite, remote would be nice though üòÅ because that is where
        the world is gravitating towards.
      </p>
      <p>I read my emails everyday so i'd get back to you ASAP! </p>
