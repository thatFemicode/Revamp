        Hi there, I'm <strong>Oluwafemi </strong>
      </h1>
      {/* <p>Frontend Developer</p> */}
      {/* <p>
        I started my software development (Frontend) journey during the
        pandemic, i had always been enthusiastic about bringing things to life
        with code but never really had the opportunity to pursue software
        development. I am currently a self-taught developer on an everyday
        journey on getting better in my craft.
      </p> */}
      <p>
        I am a frontend developer based in Lagos, Nigeria pursuing a career in
        tech, focused on creating interactive experiences on the web, working
        with various web tools such as React, Javascript amongst others to
        achieve this.
      </p>
      {/* <p>
        In my free time i really enjoy watching and listening to anything
        basketball because that is my favorite sport to watch, i had to stop
        watching football because my team gave me serious anxiety whenever they
        played ü§£ü§£.
      </p> */}
      <p>
        Generally things that interest me are basketball, startups, sports
        journalism, really wish I could be a key piece to an organization or
        startup company starting out either it be in the sports or media
        industry or otherwise as it brings an opportunity to grow and become a
        better engineer.
      </p>
      {/* <p>
        My journey in the past 1 year of software development has taught me a
        lot, patience, perseverance amongst others. I am not the smartest of
        individuals but when i put my mind to something, i try as much to make
        sure a solution is found either through enormous googling which is a
        skill for software developers or via other means.
      </p> */}
      {/* <p>
        I'm sure you have noticed the Logo you have been seeing on my screen it
        basically spells my name, OGUNLEYE OLUWAFEMI DAVID, got the inspiration
        from the late great Kobe Bryant.

        key piece to an organization or startup company starting out either it
        be in the finance industry or otherwise as it brings an opportunity to
        grow and become a better engineer. I am also gravitating towards NFT's
        although i do not seem to really get how that works, hopefully i do
        soon.

      {/* <p>
        Currently looking for my first role as a software engineer in the
        industry. I live in Lagos Nigeria and open to opportunities either
        remote or onsite, remote would be nice though üòÅ because that is where
        the world is gravitating towards.
